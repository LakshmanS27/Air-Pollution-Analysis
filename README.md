# Air-Pollution-Analysis

Air pollution is a pressing environmental issue that poses significant health risks
and challenges for cities worldwide. Air pollution occurs when several gas
emission contaminates the Air Quality. These gases are called air pollutants. The
major pollutants of air are Ozone(O3), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Ozone(O3).
This project focuses on analysing air pollution data from 15 cities in India,
including CO, NO2, O3, and PM2.5 AQI values.
The objective is to understand the causes of air pollution, predict future pollution
conditions, identify the major city impacted by each gas, and propose solutions
to mitigate pollution for future generations. The project utilizes the R
programming language for data analysis and visualization.
Firstly, the datas are obtained by importing the dataset and then these datas are
analysed by visualising the plots where each gas is categorised with respect to the
cities. Then predictive analysis is done and compared with the actual values for
identifying the trend of air pollution and finding out the major impact of a
particular gas in each cities.
The impact assessment identifies the major city where each gas has the highest
impact on pollution. By comparing average AQI values across cities, the project
pinpoints the specific gas that contributes the most to pollution in each location.
This information helps prioritize efforts and resources for pollution control and
reduction strategies.
