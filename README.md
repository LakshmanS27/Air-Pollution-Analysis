# 🌏 Air Pollution Analysis in Indian Cities

Air pollution is a pressing environmental issue that poses significant health risks and challenges for cities worldwide. This project focuses on analysing air pollution data from 15 cities in India, with a particular focus on key pollutants: **CO**, **NO₂**, **O₃**, and **PM2.5**.

The goal of this project is to:
- Understand the causes and trends of air pollution.
- Predict future pollution conditions.
- Identify the major city impacted by each gas.
- Propose solutions to mitigate pollution for future generations.

The project is implemented using **R programming language**, with data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes air quality index (AQI) values for:
- **CO**
- **NO₂**
- **O₃**
- **PM2.5**

across 15 major cities in India.

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Preparation**
   - Import the air pollution dataset.
   - Clean and explore the data.
   - Check distributions and summary statistics.

2. **Visualization**
   - Visualize the concentration of each pollutant across the cities.
   - Generate comparative bar plots and trend lines for AQI values.

3. **Predictive Analysis**
   - Use time series or trend modeling to predict future AQI values.
   - Compare predicted values with actual values to assess model performance.

4. **Impact Assessment**
   - Identify which city has the highest impact from each pollutant.
   - Calculate average AQI per pollutant per city to pinpoint hotspots.

5. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Highlight key findings.
   - Suggest mitigation strategies for policy-makers and citizens.

## 📈 Technologies Used

- **R**: Data cleaning, visualization, and analysis.
- Libraries:
  - `ggplot2`
  - `forecast` or `stats` for prediction
  - `dplyr` for data manipulation

---

## 📷 Sample Outputs

- Bar charts of pollutant levels across cities.
- Line plots showing AQI trends over time.
- Tables showing the most affected city per pollutant.
- Predicted vs Actual AQI comparison plots.

## 🚀 How to Run

1️⃣ Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Air-Pollution-Analysis.git
cd Air-Pollution-Analysis
```

2️⃣ Open the R Notebook:
- Open `Air_pollution.ipynb` in RStudio or Jupyter Notebook with an R kernel.

3️⃣ Install required packages if not already installed:
```r
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "forecast"))
```

4️⃣ Run the notebook cells step by step to reproduce the analysis.

## 📌 Findings

- Cities with highest average AQI for each pollutant were identified.
- Predicted future pollution trends show potential increases/decreases in specific gases.
- CO and PM2.5 were found to have particularly high impacts in certain urban areas.

---

## 🌱 Recommendations

- Implement stricter emission regulations in identified hotspots.
- Encourage adoption of clean energy and public transport.
- Increase green spaces and improve monitoring infrastructure.
